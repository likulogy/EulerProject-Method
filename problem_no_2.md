# Problem
## Even Fibonacci Numbers
- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Solution
1. find Fibonacci sequence

first of all, I need to generate Fibonacci sequence from minimum, and maximum values.

```python
    def generateFibonacci(min, max):
        fibonacci = [] # define empty list
        x = min
        while x < max:
            if 0<=len(fibonacci)<2:
                fibonacci.append(x) #[min, min]
            else:
                x = fibonacci[-1] + fibonacci[-2] #(N-1) + (N-2) = N
                if x < max:
                    fibonacci.append(x) # [min, min, N]
        fibonacci = fibonacci[1:] # [min, N]
        return fibonacci
```
in the code described above generates fibonacci sequence using list slicing.

2. test number in fibonacci sequence is even number.

checking given number is even or not is quite simple on python with built-in operator `%`. 

`A % B` operator return residual value when A devided by B. if returned value is equal to zero, given value is even number.

with that, we could form one statement to check number is even or not.

```python
sum = 0
    for i in fib:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum = sum + i
        else:
            continue
```

we are just needing 'sum' value of even numbers in fibonacci sequence simple code possible.
